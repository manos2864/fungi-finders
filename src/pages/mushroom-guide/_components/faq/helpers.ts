        mesh bag for collecting, and paper bags for separating specimens. Bring
        a small brush for cleaning, wear sturdy boots, and carry a GPS device or
        compass to track your location. A camera is also helpful to document

    content: `Learn from experienced foragers and reliable guidebooks – never rely on
        apps alone. Study each mushroom's specific features like cap shape, gill
        structure, stem characteristics, and spore prints. Start with easily
        identifiable species that have no poisonous lookalikes, and never eat
        anything unless you're completely certain of its identification.`,

    title: "Where can I find foraging spots?",
    content: `Look in deciduous forests, especially near oak and maple trees, and in
        damp, shaded areas. Fallen logs and dead trees are often productive
        spots. Only forage on public lands where it's allowed, and always check
        local regulations. Remember to get permission for private property and
        keep your best locations private to prevent over-harvesting.`,

    content: `Spring is ideal for morels, late summer brings chanterelles and boletes,
        and fall is peak season for most mushrooms including oysters and hen of
        the woods. Some species can even be found in winter, especially in
        milder climates. Each season offers different varieties, so year-round
        foraging is possible.`,
